JKD can interact with the SCR and SHR proteins implicated in root patterning, as well as another zinc finger transcription factor, MAGPIE. All of these interactions require the first zinc finger in JKD according to a Y2H assay. There are also transcriptional interactions among these proteins. The initiation of JKD transcription does not appear to depend on SCR and SHR, but later expression in the post-embryonic QC cells and ground tissue initials is reduced in scr and shr mutants. JKD also appears to be required for SCR transcription beginning in the embryo. There is also some evidence that JKD plays a role in promoting the movement of SHR into the nucleus, particularly in QC cells, but this may be indirect.","JACKDAW (JKD); FUNCTIONS IN: protein binding, protein homodimerization activity, sequence-specific DNA binding transcription factor activity, zinc ion binding, nucleic acid binding; INVOLVED IN: regulation of epidermal cell differentiation, regulation of meristem growth, regulation of cell division, root development, regulation of transcription; LOCATED IN: intracellular; EXPRESSED IN: 6 plant structures; EXPRESSED DURING: 6 growth stages; CONTAINS InterPro DOMAIN/s: Zinc finger, C2H2-like (InterPro:IPR015880), Zinc finger, C2H2-type (InterPro:IPR007087), Zinc finger, double-stranded RNA binding (InterPro:IPR022755); BEST Arabidopsis thaliana protein match is: C2H2-like zinc finger protein (TAIR:AT5G66730.1); Has 56579 Blast hits to 20803 proteins in 357 species: Archae - 0; Bacteria - 66; Metazoa - 49427; Fungi - 692; Plants - 856; Viruses - 6; Other Eukaryotes - 5532 (source: NCBI BLink).",JKD,JACKDAW

The protein was shown to bind to methylated cytosines of CG, CNG and CNN motifs via its SRA domain but has a preference for the latter two.

AT2G47460,PFG1,TF,AT2G47460.1,myb domain protein 12,"MYB12 belongs to subgroup 7 of the R2R3-MYB family. It strongly activates the promoters of chalcone synthase (CHS), flavanone 3-hydroxylase (F3H), flavonol synthase (FLS) and - to a lesser extent - chalcone flavanone isomerase (CHI), but cannot activate the promoters of flavonoid-3'hydroxylase (F3'H) and dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (DF). The activation requires a functional MYB recognition element (MRE). Results from the myb12-1f allele indicate that an activation domain might be present in the C-terminus. Overexpression or knock-out plants do not show any obvious phenotype under greenhouse conditions. Young myb12-ko seedlings contain reduced amounts of flavonoids (quercetin and kaempferol), while seedlings as well as leaves of MYB12-OX plants displayed an increased flavonoid content. They did not show any significant difference in anthocyanin content. Expression of CHS and FLS shows a clear correlation to MYB12 expression levels. CHI and F3H show increased transcript levels in the MYB12-OX lines, but no differences in the knock-out. Even in the absence of functional MYB12, flavonol biosynthesis is not completely absent, suggesting functional redundancy.  The redundant factors are MYB11 and MYB111 although MYB12 is primarily required for flavonol biosynthesis in roots.","myb domain protein 12 (MYB12); CONTAINS InterPro DOMAIN/s: SANT, DNA-binding (InterPro:IPR001005), Homeodomain-like (InterPro:IPR009057), Myb, DNA-binding (InterPro:IPR014778), HTH transcriptional regulator, Myb-type, DNA-binding (InterPro:IPR017930), Homeodomain-related (InterPro:IPR012287), Myb transcription factor (InterPro:IPR015495); BEST Arabidopsis thaliana protein match is: myb domain protein 11 (TAIR:AT3G62610.1); Has 8833 Blast hits to 8133 proteins in 470 species: Archae - 0; Bacteria - 0; Metazoa - 786; Fungi - 423; Plants - 5965; Viruses - 6; Other Eukaryotes - 1653 (source: NCBI BLink).",PFG1,PRODUCTION OF FLAVONOL GLYCOSIDES 1

Its promoter is highly modular with each region contributing to specific aspects of the gene's spatial and temporal expression.  Double mutant analysis with PDF2, another L1-specific gene, suggests that their functions are partially redundant and the absence of both of the genes result in abnormal shoot development.","MERISTEM LAYER 1 (ATML1); FUNCTIONS IN: sequence-specific DNA binding, DNA binding, sequence-specific DNA binding transcription factor activity; INVOLVED IN: epidermal cell differentiation, regulation of transcription, DNA-dependent, cotyledon development; LOCATED IN: nucleus; EXPRESSED IN: 29 plant structures; EXPRESSED DURING: 14 growth stages; CONTAINS InterPro DOMAIN/s: Homeobox, conserved site (InterPro:IPR017970), Homeobox (InterPro:IPR001356), Homeodomain-like (InterPro:IPR009057), Lipid-binding START (InterPro:IPR002913), Homeodomain-related (InterPro:IPR012287); BEST Arabidopsis thaliana protein match is: protodermal factor 2 (TAIR:AT4G04890.1); Has 35333 Blast hits to 34131 proteins in 2444 species: Archae - 798; Bacteria - 22429; Metazoa - 974; Fungi - 991; Plants - 531; Viruses - 0; Other Eukaryotes - 9610 (source: NCBI BLink).",ATML1,MERISTEM LAYER 1
